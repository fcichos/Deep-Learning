    "One field, which is increasingly important also in physics is the field of machine learning. Machine learning is the summarizing term for a number of computational procedures to extract useful information from data. We would like to spend the rest of the course to introduce you into a tiny part of machine learning. We will do that in a way that you calculate as much as possible in pure Python without any additional packages."

Two things have been stimmulating the current hype of machine learning techniques. One is the computational power that is available already at the level of your smartphone. The second one is the availability of data. Machine learning is divided into different areas, which are denotes as \n",
