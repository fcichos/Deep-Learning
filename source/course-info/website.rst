   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This Website
============

This website will contain all the information that are required for our **Deep Learning Module** Course hands-on. The hands-on is using Jupyter Notebooks to provide you some examples of Python code for specific applications i.e. 

- reinforcement learning for navigation in the grid world
- single perceptron
- multilayer perceptron for character recognition
- convolutional neural network for character recognition
- convolutional auto-encoder for noise removal in time series

You do not need to install any software. The notebooks are executed with the help of the myBinder service. 

1. **myBinder** service to host Jupyter Notebooks (https://mybinder.org). The Binder project offers an easy place to share computing environments to everyone

    When you are exploring the following website you will notice the following icon on several places. 

    |Substitution Name|

    This icon indicates that this webpage is based on a Jupyter Notebook. Rather than just looking at the website, you may click on the icon and the myBinder service will be opened to allow you to interactively use the notebook. *Please be patient and wait until binder has started.*  All notebooks on myBinder will be hosted temporarily. If you show inactivity for to long, the server will close the connection. If you are finsihed working on a notebook, you may download it to keep a copy. Go ahead and click on the icon to get an empty notebook.

2. **GitHub and GitHub Pages** for hosting notebooks and website (https://github.com). GitHub is a great place to host you collaborative coding projects including version control. In the upper right corner, you will also find a link to the GitHub repository hosting the notebooks.

3. **Anaconda Jupyter package** for creating the notebooks (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). The anaconda package privides you with the Jupyter Notebook environment including Python. If you want to use Jupyter at home without online access, this is a good package to install.
